I made further progress in the empwage repository with two new branches:

feature/fc3: Added functionality to calculate and return the exact number of hours the employee worked.
feature/fc4: Extended the program to track employee attendance and earnings for 20 days:
Each day, the program checks if the employee is present or absent.
If present, calculates daily earnings based on hours worked:
0 hours: 0 Rs
4 hours: 80 Rs
8 hours: 160 Rs
Tracks daily earnings and calculates the total earnings over 20 days.
This systematic approach enhances the program's functionality while maintaining structured branch development.
