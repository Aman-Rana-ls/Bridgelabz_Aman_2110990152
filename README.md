I have created a repository named empwage and developed two branches to manage features:

feature/fc1: This branch contains a program that checks whether a person is present or absent.

feature/fc2: This branch extends the functionality of feature/fc1 by adding a feature to calculate the work hours and corresponding wages if the person is present:

0 hours: Earned 0 Rs.
4 hours (half-time): Earned 80 Rs.
8 hours (full-time): Earned 160 Rs.
This structure shows incremental development, with feature/fc2 building upon feature/fc1.
